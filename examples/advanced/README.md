# Example - Advanced

This example includes all variables to display as features of the module as possible, including the usage of outside modules to interact with AKS.

> NOTE: You may experience issues after first plan with the `helm_release.ingress_nginx` resource. This works on Apply fine but subsequent applies fail and it's probably best not to do it. Either way you have a nice example of using some extra config in [kube.tf](./kube.tf). Read [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs#stacking-with-managed-kubernetes-cluster-resources) for more info.
